            <h2 class="main htmlAccent">Learn HTML</h2>
            <p>Welcome to the HTML Portal. Here you can find everything you need to learn the basic fundamentals of HTML. HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language, which may seem like
                nonsense at first. But really, this HTML powers everything your looking at right now. You know, all those sites like Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Tiktok, Instagram,
                rely on HTML to function. Every Facebook Post, Youtube Title, Tweet, Story, Video, Message, almost everthing requires HTML to work. Let's get ready to learn HTML. To do so 
                we need to Set-up our coding Environment. A 'coding environment' is essentially where you will write your code and execute it. At the moment we will execute our code locally, 
                we will learn to launch a real site further down the line. Let's get into the Set-up.
            </p>
        </div>


        <div id="setup" class="content">
            <h3 class="sub-topic htmlAccent">VSCode Set-Up</h3>
            <p>The way you Set-Up will depend on your system. If your device is capable of downloading and running programs, continue reading, if not, <a class="smooth" href="#Replit">click here</a>. To execute our code, 
               we are going to use VSCode, which is one of the most popular code editors out there. You can download it for macOS, Windows, or Linux <a target="_blank" href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">here</a>.
               Before we open VSCode, we are going to create a text file in our PC and name it index.html. 'index.html' is the common name for HTML files and every HTML file you make should be called index.html.
               The next step is to complete our download and open VSCode. Once opened, click the 'Open File' option and select the index.html file we created earlier. At this point, your VSCode should look something like 
               this (Your layout may look different):
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="setup1.PNG">
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Cool, you have most of your coding environment set-up. But if you look closely, in the bottom right of my screen, it says "Go Live", an option you do not have. Don't worry
               it is not too complicated. What you want to do it navigate to the extensions section. We can use the CTRL + SHIFT + X shortcut to get there. Once there, we want to search up
               'live server' in the search bar. We are looking for the extension with a purple icon made by Ritwick Dey, click on the extension and you should have a screen that looks like this:
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="setup2.PNG">
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Great, now all we have to do is click install and we are done with our setup. live-server creates a local web server so we can put our code online and actually see it.
                 You can close the extension tab and return to your index.html file. You should see a 'Go Live' button in the bottom right now. If you click it, you will see a blank 
                 browser page open up, if so, then you have setup properly, you can now move onto the next section.
            </p>
        </div>



        <div class="content">
            <h3 id="Replit" class="sub-topic htmlAccent">Repl.it Set-Up</h3>
            <p>If your device is incapable of download and running programs, don't worry, there are other ways to write our code. We can use <a target="_blank" href="https://replit.com/">Repl.it</a>, which is a website that compiles
                the important HTML services and allows you to use them without downloading a thing. To set-up, go to Repl.it and sign up. Once you have signed up and reached your dashboard,
                go to the top left and click the 'Create +' button. You will now see a modal pop-up asking you which template you would like to use. We will be using the HTML, CSS, JS (Auto-Refresh)
                template. So search up HTML and make sure you click the template with Auto-Refresh because that will make our life easier. Title your Repl anything you want and 'Create Repl'.
                Your screen should look like so: 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="image">
            <img src="setup3.PNG">
        </div>
        <div class="content">
            <p>Brilliant, you have now set-up Repl for our HTML code. Be aware that Repl is only a minified version and lacks some features that an installation would have. Be sure to download
                VSCode on another device when you have the chance as VSCode is a professional coding environment. Even professional web designers use VSCode to write their code, but for now, Repl
                should be more than enough!
            </p>
        </div>




      <div id="howHTMLWorks" class="content">
          <h3 class="sub-topic htmlAccent">How HTML Works</h3>
          <p>HTML is a language the utilizes pre-coded elements to display information. Usually, elements are formatted with a less than sign, followed by the element name, followed by a greater than sign,
            followed by optional text, followed by a less than sign, followed by a slash, followed by the element name again and finally ending with a greater than sign. Complicated huh? Not really.
            Do not be intimidated by this, you will see in future lessons that this is much easier than it seems. Heck, let's see an example of it in play right now! Right click anywhere on this screen and 
            then select 'inspect'. You should see a window like this:
          </p>
      </div>
      <div class="image">
        <img src="html1.PNG">
      </div>

      <div class="content">
        <p>This is the DevTools console. Right now, don't worry about all the tabs at the top, the console at the bottom and the stuff on the right (That's CSS!). What we want to be looking at is 
          that beautiful blue and orange code on the left, That's HTML! You may not understand a lot of what you see, but you can see the elements we were talking about earlier. We can see the 
          html element, the head element, a body element, many div elements (yes you can have multiple of the same element!) among other elements. Again don't be overwhelmed, we will go over every element
          and you will be able to read this code like a book soon!
        </p>
    </div>


    <div id="htmlStructure" class="content">
      <h3 class="sub-topic htmlAccent">HTML Structure</h3>
      <p>If your using VSCode, in your file, type html:5 and press enter. If your using Repl.it, you should already have the HTML structure on your screen. Now, you don't need to memorize this, but we are 
        going to dissect it. First at the top you see &lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;. It literally means document type. What this does is that it tells the browser, in my case Google Chrome, to render the text as HTML. Nowadays browsers
        can sense what language you are using but it is a safe practice to always include the document type at the top.  
      </p>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Next we have the &lt;html&gt;&lt;/html&gt; tag. It is where we are going to put all our html. As a rule of thumb, you should never have anything except the Doctype outside of your html tag. Your HTML file should always
      end in an html tag.
    </p>
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    <p>Next we have the &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; tag. If you have ever taken an english test with articles, the head tag is the blurb
      at the beginning with all the information about the passage. It contains all the information of our web page. It is really important to note that the head tag never displays anything.
      You might see the &lt;meta charset="UTF-8"&gt; and be confused, dont worry, it only looks complicated. What it does is tell the webpage "Hey browser, this page uses a collection of over 1.1 Million
      different characters". Essentially it makes it so all these different languages work: Здравствуй, 
      hæ, හායි, こんにちは,你好. The meta tag itself stands for metadata, which is basically background information. It is something that almost every site has so always include it. Next is the &lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width"&gt;. 
      Again, it looks quite complicated but all it does is that it makes it so your site fits on all screens including phones and tablets. Do note that meta tags are self-closing, meaning that they dont require a second tag to close it off. There are 
      many self closing tags, you will learn more about them in the future. Next is the &lt;title&gt;Website Name&lt;/title&gt; tag. This is the name that will show in the browser tab at the top of the page, pretty easy. Everything else you may see in the 
      head is not required yet so you may delete it if you like.
  </div>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Next is the &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; tag. If the head tag is the blurb, then the body tag is the whole passage. Here is where the actual work goes and where you will be spending a lot of your time when coding html. If there is anything within your body tag
      delete it all now because we are going to fill it up in the <a href="https://asgharkazmi2005.github.io/Codify.net/html/basicElements/">next section</a>. Let's understand some of the basic elements.
